I automated chrome dino game using python
HI, viewers this is sanjar khan from computer science background with knee interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence which are the pace of the new generation
Now geting into the trick i played to end to end automate the chrome dino game
  -->Here i used PYAUTOGUI and PIL libraries to hold down the keys and to grab a screenshot respectively.
  -->after i grab the image i converted the image from color to grey because it is easy to manipulate gray image than colored.
  -->now gray image has pixels x and y ..starting from the origin(0,0) which top left corner of the image(i.e screen of the laptop) 
      and i adjusted the both x and y using two loops(i.e outer for x and inner for y) in such a manner so that it can be colloid with cactus and bird.
      -->the important thing i want to mention is if the data of the image is 0 then it BLACK and as the value increases then the color tends to turn and becomes white 
      at 255.
      -->By using this concept of image i will find out the cactus and bird and press the respective key.
   THIS IS HOW I AUTOMATED.
                                                  thank u github..
